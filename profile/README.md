## What is StarGuild?

**StarGuild** is a web-based platform designed to enhance the experience of managing and participating in Star Citizen organizations. Star Citizen players face limited in-game tools to organize and grow their communities. StarGuild bridges that gap by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and features to manage members, events, and operations while fostering social interaction and discovery.

Our mission is to:
- Provide **organization leaders** with powerful tools to manage their communities.
- Empower **players** to connect with like-minded individuals and find organizations that match their playstyle and goals.
- Foster a vibrant, **community-driven ecosystem** for the Star Citizen universe.
